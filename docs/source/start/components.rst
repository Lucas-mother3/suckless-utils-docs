Components
==========

In this section, we are documenting basic functionality and information about each and every ``suckless-utils`` component. 

.. note::
  As stated in the installation part,
  Some components might be also be available on your distro's repository (for example the Arch User Repository). 
  Refer to your distro's package management for more info.

.. tip::
  You could change the keybinds of most components, but I don't usually reccommend doing it as it might
  conflict with the other component's keybinds.
